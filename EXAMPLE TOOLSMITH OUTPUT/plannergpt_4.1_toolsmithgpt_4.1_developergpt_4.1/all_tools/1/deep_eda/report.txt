## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1
What are the key statistical findings regarding each numerical feature in relation to the target variable 'NObeyesdad'?
### Answer 1
Key findings from the numerical feature summary stratified by obesity class include:
- **Age**: Median ages increase with obesity class from `Insufficient_Weight` (19.36) to `Obesity_Type_II` (27.70), with `Obesity_Type_I` and `Overweight_Level_II` reflecting similar median ages (around 24-25).  
- **Height**: There is less variation in median height across classes, but `Obesity_Type_II` has the lowest median height.
- **Weight**: The median weight rises significantly from `Insufficient_Weight` (47.78 kg) to `Obesity_Type_III` (102.88 kg), indicating a clear trend of increasing weight with obesity class.
- **BMI**: The median BMI also shows a significant increase from `Insufficient_Weight` (17.51) to `Obesity_Type_III` (41.75), confirming the primary role of BMI in obesity classification.

### Question 2
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.
### Answer 2
The features involved in this phase include:
- **Numerical Features**: `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`, `BMI` were analyzed for statistical significance and associations with the target variable `NObeyesdad`.
- **Categorical Features**: `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS` were summarized and tested for associations with the target variable.

No features were deleted or modified in this phase. However, exploratory analyses may suggest future feature engineering opportunities based on the insights gained.

### Question 3
What potential feature interactions were identified, and how might they influence the target variable?
### Answer 3
The correlation heatmap revealed several interactions:
- **Weight and BMI**: These features have a strong positive correlation (0.94), suggesting one could be removed or combined as they convey similar information.
- **Age and BMI**: A moderate positive correlation (0.34) indicates that as age increases, BMI tends to rise, possibly pointing to lifestyle changes affecting weight over time.
- **Height and Weight**: A moderate correlation (0.42) indicates taller individuals are likely to weigh more, which could influence BMI and obesity class.
- **FAF (Physical Activity Frequency) and BMI**: A weak negative correlation (-0.21) suggests that increased physical activity may help lower BMI, thus affecting obesity classifications.

### Question 4
What multicollinearity issues were identified among the numerical features, and which features should be considered for removal or combination?
### Answer 4
Multicollinearity issues were observed between:
- **Weight and BMI**: The high correlation (0.94) suggests one could be removed or combined as they convey similar information.
- **Height and Weight**: Moderate correlation (0.42) could suggest consideration for removal of one feature depending on the model complexity.
- **FAF and BMI**: Given the weak correlation, these features do not exhibit significant multicollinearity, but further evaluation in modeling could provide clarity.

### Question 5
Were there any surprising patterns or insights regarding obesity class segmentation and lifestyle factors that could inform new feature creation?
### Answer 5
Surprising insights include:
- The age distribution showed younger individuals classified as `Insufficient_Weight` and `Normal_Weight`, while obesity classes had a broader age range, suggesting that lifestyle factors may evolve with age.
- Higher obesity classes corresponded with a lack of calorie monitoring, suggesting potential for a new feature that combines dietary habits and monitoring.
- The significant outliers in age for `Normal_Weight` and `Obesity_Type_I` indicate that older individuals can exist in lower obesity classes, pointing to the need for age-adjusted lifestyle interventions.

### Question 6
Based on the visualizations and statistical tests, which features or combinations of features would you prioritize for engineering new variables, and what transformations do you propose?
### Answer 6
- **BMI and Weight**: Given their high correlation, creating a composite feature that combines both might reduce redundancy while retaining critical information.
- **Age and Lifestyle Factors**: Combining age with lifestyle factors (e.g., FAVC and SCC) into a "Risk Profile" feature could enhance predictive power regarding obesity risk.
- **Technology Usage (TUE) and Physical Activity (FAF)**: These could be combined to create a "Lifestyle Balance" feature that captures a balance between sedentary and active behavior.

Transformations to consider include:
- Normalizing or standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.
- Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding for better representation in machine learning models.
