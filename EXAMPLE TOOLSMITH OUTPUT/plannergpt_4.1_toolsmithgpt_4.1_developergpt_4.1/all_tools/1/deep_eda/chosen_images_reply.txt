To select the most relevant images for the in-depth exploratory data analysis phase, I will consider the importance of each image in understanding the relationships between different features and the target variable (obesity class). Here’s a breakdown of the images:

1. **boxplot_Age_vs_obesity_class.png** - This image will help visualize how age is distributed across different obesity classes, which is essential for understanding age-related risks.
  
2. **boxplot_Weight_vs_obesity_class.png** - Like the age boxplot, this will provide insights into how weight correlates with obesity classes.

3. **boxplot_Height_vs_obesity_class.png** - This boxplot can help identify the relationship between height and obesity classes, adding another dimension to the analysis.

4. **correlation_heatmap_numerical_features.png** - This heatmap will be crucial for understanding the correlations between numerical features, which can inform feature engineering and model building.

Given the relevance of these images to the in-depth analysis and their usefulness for the next phase of feature engineering, I will select all four images as they collectively provide a comprehensive view of the data.

Here's the response in the required format:

```json
{
    "images": [
        "boxplot_Age_vs_obesity_class.png",
        "boxplot_Weight_vs_obesity_class.png",
        "boxplot_Height_vs_obesity_class.png",
        "correlation_heatmap_numerical_features.png"
    ]
}
```
