Competition Overview\nThe \"obesity_risks\" competition is a part of the Kaggle Playground Series, focusing on predicting obesity risk in individuals related to cardiovascular diseases. The competition runs from February 1, 2024, to March 1, 2024, and submissions are evaluated based on accuracy.\n\n## 2. Files\n- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing features and the target variable `NObeyesdad`.\n- **test.csv**: The test dataset for which predictions need to be made.\n- **sample_submission.csv**: A template to demonstrate the required submission format.\n\n## 3. Problem Definition\nParticipants are tasked with predicting the obesity classification of individuals based on various demographic and lifestyle features. The target variable `NObeyesdad` categorizes individuals into different obesity risk levels.\n\n## 4. Data Information\n### 4.1 Data type\n#### 4.1.1 ID type\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point (not used in model training).\n\n#### 4.1.2 Numerical type\n- `Age`: Age of individuals (in years).\n- `Height`: Height of individuals (in meters).\n- `Weight`: Weight of individuals (in kilograms).\n- `CH2O`: Daily water intake (liters).\n- `FAF`: Frequency of physical activity.\n- `TUE`: Time spent exercising (in hours).\n- `CALC`: Daily calcium intake (grams).\n\n#### 4.1.3 Categorical type\n- `Gender`: Gender of individuals (Male/Female).\n- `family_history_with_overweight`: Family history of overweight (yes/no).\n- `FAVC`: Food intake frequency (yes/no).\n- `FCVC`: Frequency of vegetable consumption (numerical scale).\n- `NCP`: Number of meals consumed per day (numerical scale).\n- `CAEC`: Consumption of food between meals (categorical).\n- `SMOKE`: Smoking status (yes/no).\n- `SCC`: Self-calculated calories (yes/no).\n- `MTRANS`: Means of transportation (categorical).\n- `NObeyesdad`: Level of obesity (target variable).\n\n#### 4.1.4 Datetime type\n- None.\n\n### 4.2 Detailed data description\nThe dataset consists of training and test segments, capturing demographic and lifestyle information. The target variable `NObeyesdad` classifies individuals into obesity levels ranging from \"Insufficient Weight\" to \"Obesity Type III.\" The training data includes various age groups, height and weight variations, and lifestyle behaviors.\n\n## 5. Target Variable\nThe target variable `NObeyesdad` categorizes obesity levels into the following classes:\n- \"Insufficient Weight\"\n- \"Normal Weight\"\n- \"Overweight Level I\"\n- \"Overweight Level II\"\n- \"Obesity Type I\"\n- \"Obesity Type II\"\n- \"Obesity Type III\"\n\n## 6. Evaluation Metrics\nSubmissions will be evaluated based on the accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted classifications.\n\n## 7. Submission Format\nThe submission file must include the following columns:\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `NObeyesdad`: Predicted obesity classification.\n\nAn example submission format:\n```\nid,NObeyesdad\n20758,Normal_Weight\n20759,Normal_Weight\n20760,Obesity Type I\n```\n\n## 8. Other Key Aspects\n- The competition utilizes a synthetically generated dataset, allowing for a balance between real-world data characteristics and confidentiality of test labels.\n- Participants are encouraged to explore data visualizations, clustering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) as part of their solutions.\n- Prizes consist of Kaggle merchandise, with limitations on multiple wins by the same individual.\n\n# TASK\n\nYou are now designing ML tools for the current development phase: Data Cleaning.\nYour tools should include BOTH:\n1. Dataset-specific tools: Tailored to the unique characteristics of this dataset\n2. Commonly reusable tools: General-purpose utilities applicable across data science tasks\n\nThe Planner and Developer will use these tools to execute tasks in this phase.\nI will provide you with DATASET BACKGROUND, PHASE Information, and previous reports and plans.\n\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the tools:\n1. Understand the dataset domain and phase objectives.\n2. Identify dataset-specific needs (e.g., domain-specific transformations, dataset-specific patterns)\n3. Identify commonly needed operations for this phase type (e.g., standard EDA plots, generic cleaners)\n4. For each tool, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"Is this tool dataset-specific or generally reusable?\"\n    - \"What parameters should this tool accept to be flexible?\"\n    - \"Which data types (numerical, categorical, datetime, ID) does this tool handle?\"\n    - \"What are the expected inputs and outputs?\"\n    - \"What constraints or edge cases must the tool handle?\"\n5. Ensure tools are:\n    - Phase-appropriate (EDA tools differ from cleaning or feature engineering tools)\n    - Well-balanced (mix of specific + general utilities)\n    - Well-documented (clear parameter descriptions, applicable situations, and usage notes)\n    - Compliant with README format (Markdown documentation)\n\nDesign as many tools as needed to comprehensively support this phase, but prioritize quality over quantity.\nFocus on tools that will be most useful to the Planner and Developer.\n\nImportant: Strongly prioritize domain-specific (dataset background-aware) tools whenever they provide clear value. Make their domain rationale explicit so users understand why they are beneficial for this dataset.\n\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\n## CONSTRAINTS ##\n1. Tool Balance:\n   - Design tools appropriate for phase: Data Cleaning\n   - Include BOTH dataset-specific AND generic data science tools\n   - Prioritize dataset-specific tools when they add measurable value (keep a healthy mix)\n   - Prioritize quality and usefulness over quantity\n   \n2. Technical Requirements:\n   - Use only: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn\n   - No file I/O operations inside tools\n   - No network calls or external dependencies\n   - All tools must be pure functions (no global state modifications)\n\n3. Design Principles:\n   - Parameterize column names (never hard-code feature names)\n   - Provide clear, actionable error messages\n   - Handle edge cases gracefully (empty DataFrames, missing columns, wrong types)\n   - Include type hints for all parameters and return values\n   - Document assumptions and limitations in notes\n   - Mark in description whether tool is \"dataset-specific\" or \"generic\"\n   - For dataset-specific tools, include a brief \"Domain rationale\" note explaining why the tool fits this dataset background\n\n4. Output Requirements:\n   - Each tool MUST have markdown documentation\n   - Follow exact README format for Markdown\n\n\n#############\n# START TOOL DESIGN #\nBefore you begin, please request the following information from me, which contain important information that will guide your tool design for current phase:\n0. CURRENT phase specific tool GUIDELINES\n1. CURRENT phase available features\n2. CURRENT phase data preview\n3. Previous phases' plans and reports\n"

Each record represents a unique person. The numerical features (such as age, height, weight) are continuous and likely important for BMI calculations. Several lifestyle and behavioral features are categorical, capturing habits related to food, exercise, and substance use.\n\nNotable patterns from the sample:\n- Both genders are present.\n- Age ranges from teens to early 30s in the sample.\n- Heights and weights vary, suggesting a mix of BMI categories.\n- Many features deal with frequency or presence of health-related habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol, fast food).\n- The `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, and similar features are mostly binary (`yes`/`no`).\n- Some features, like `CAEC` and `CALC`, have ordinal categorical values indicating frequency.\n- The target variable is multiclass with labels indicating different obesity levels.\n\n## Target Variable\n\n- **NObeyesdad**: Categorical variable indicating the obesity level of the individual. Sample values include:\n  - `Insufficient_Weight`\n  - `Normal_Weight`\n  - `Overweight_Level_I`\n  - `Overweight_Level_II`\n  - `Obesity_Type_I`\n  - `Obesity_Type_II`\n  - `Obesity_Type_III`\n\n## Submission format (if applicable)\n\nThe submission file should include:\n- `id`: Unique identifier (integer).\n- `NObeyesdad`: Predicted obesity level (categorical string).\n\nEach row corresponds to an individual from the test set, with their predicted `NObeyesdad` value.\nPrevious Plans and Reports:\n## UNDERSTAND BACKGROUND ##\nThere is no plan in this phase.\n## PRELIMINARY EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ##\nPreliminary Exploratory Data Analysis Plan\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Summarize and audit feature types, basic statistics, unique values, and missingness for all features in both train and test datasets.\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- Tools:\n  - `summarize_numerical_features` for numerical features (`Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`)\n  - `summarize_categorical_features` for categorical features (`Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS`, and `NObeyesdad` for train)\n  - Pandas `.is_unique` and `.isnull().sum()` for `id`\n- Parameters:\n  - Use both train and test dataframes\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Text tables summarizing statistics, unique values, and missing counts for each feature group\n- Text summary on `id` column uniqueness and missingness\n- No changes to data;

Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.\n### Answer 1\n- **Processed Files:**\n  - Training Data: `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/train.csv`\n  - Testing Data: `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/test.csv`\n\n- **Generated Files:**\n  - Numerical distributions plot for the train data: `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/numerical_distributions_train.png`\n  - Categorical counts plot for the train data: `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/categorical_counts_train.png`\n  - BMI vs Target plot for the train data: `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/bmi_vs_target_train.png`\n  - Weight vs Target plot for the train data: `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/weight_vs_target_boxplot.png`\n\n### Question 2\nWhich features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. (This is a FIXED question for each phase.)\n### Answer 2\n- **Involved Features:**\n  - **Numerical Features:** `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`\n  - **Categorical Features:** `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS`, `NObeyesdad` (target variable)\n\n- **Changes:**\n  - No features were deleted or created in this phase.\n  - Feature types remain unchanged as they are primarily descriptive analyses, with no modifications to data types or values.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat unique features were identified in the datasets, and did any of them exhibit unexpected data types or distributions?\n### Answer 3\n- The dataset includes features related to demographics, lifestyle, and obesity-related health factors.\n- **Unique features:**\n  - `id`: Unique identifier (integer).\n  - `NObeyesdad`: Multi-class categorical variable indicating obesity levels.\n- **Unexpected Data Types/Distributions:**\n  - All features appear to have appropriate data types as per their definitions.\n  - Some numerical features such as `Weight` show a multimodal distribution, which may require further investigation but is not necessarily unexpected.\n\n### Question 4\nWhat is the extent of missing values across numerical and categorical features, and how might these affect the analysis?\n### Answer 4\n- **Missing Values:**\n  - All features across both train and test datasets report zero missing values.\n- **Implications:**\n  - The absence of missing values suggests that there should be no immediate concerns about data integrity or the need for imputation. However, this should be continually monitored in subsequent phases for any updates or changes in data.\n\n### Question 5\nWere any outliers detected in the numerical features, particularly for `Age`, `Height`, and `Weight`, and what implications could these outliers have on the analysis?\n### Answer 5\n- **Outliers Detected:**\n  - Outliers were identified using an IQR method across numerical features including `Age`, `Height`, and `Weight`.\n  - Specific counts and ratios of outliers were provided in the output.\n  \n- **Implications:**\n  - The presence of outliers could skew the results of statistical analyses, such as means and correlations, and may influence model performance. They will need to be addressed in the data cleaning phase.\n\n### Question 6\nHow are the target variable (`NObeyesdad`) distributions shaped by the other features, and are there any anomalies in these relationships that need to be addressed?\n### Answer 6\n- The distribution of the target variable `NObeyesdad` was analyzed through counts and visualizations.\n- **Insights:**\n  - Different obesity types have distinct BMI distributions, indicating clear separations that can inform model training.\n  - Some overlaps between categories may suggest the need for careful modeling to differentiate between similar classes.\n  \n- **Anomalies:**\n  - No major anomalies were noted, but the need for further exploration of overlapping categories may inform future model complexity.\n\n### Question 7\nWhat insights were gained regarding the relationships between features (e.g., dietary habits, lifestyle factors) and obesity levels, and how should these inform the data cleaning process?\n### Answer 7\n- **Insights:**\n  - Features such as frequency of vegetable consumption (`FCVC`), number of meals (`NCP`), and physical activity (`FAF`) show patterns that correlate with obesity levels.\n  - The analysis indicated a need to focus on dietary habits and lifestyle factors that may contribute to obesity.\n  \n- **Data Cleaning Implications:**\n  - Features that exhibit high variability or outliers should be examined more closely for potential errors and corrections in the next phase.\n  - Consideration should also be given to how categorical variables interact and if they need encoding for model training.\n\n### Question 8\nWhat specific data characteristics or inconsistencies were observed that could hinder model performance, and what steps should be taken in the next phase to address them?\n### Answer 8\n- **Characteristics and Inconsistencies:**\n  - Outliers in numerical features could skew analyses and predictions.\n  - Some categorical variables may overlap in meaning or responses, complicating interpretation.\n  \n- **Next Steps:**\n  - Address outliers by analyzing their sources and potentially removing or transforming them.\n  - Investigate categorical features for redundancy or overlap and consider consolidating categories where appropriate.\n  - Begin preparing for feature engineering by exploring interactions between key variables.\n\n\n\n"
