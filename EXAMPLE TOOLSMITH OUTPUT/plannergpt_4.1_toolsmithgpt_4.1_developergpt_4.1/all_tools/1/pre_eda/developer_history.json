        "content": "You are an excellent developer.\nYou are skilled at writing and implementing code according to plan.\n when you are writing code, you should follow the plan and the following constraints.\n\n# CONSTRAINTS #\n\n## DATA HANDLING ##\n1. Data Loading:\n   - Always load data files from the `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/` directory.\n   - Use specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Model Building, Validation, and Prediction: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n2. Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/` directory. Whenever you call any visualization tool, save its returned figure/axes/array immediately to `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/`.\n   - Save data files in the `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## PHASE BOUNDARIES & NON-DUPLICATION ##\n1. Do not redo work from earlier phases.\n   - Data Cleaning tasks (e.g., missing value imputation, basic type fixes, obvious outlier removal) must NOT be repeated in Feature Engineering or Model Building.\n   - Feature Engineering tasks (e.g., encoding, scaling, feature creation/selection) must NOT be repeated in Model Building.\n2. Always consume the right artifacts for the current phase:\n   - Feature Engineering reads `cleaned_train.csv`/`cleaned_test.csv` and produces `processed_train.csv`/`processed_test.csv`.\n   - Model Building reads ONLY `processed_train.csv`/`processed_test.csv` and focuses on model training, validation, and prediction.\n3. If a model requires a transformation not present in the processed data (rare):\n   - Implement it inside an `sklearn` `Pipeline` attached to the model.\n   - Fit on training data only; apply to both train/test consistently.\n   - Do NOT write new intermediate files and do NOT alter upstream artifacts.\n4. Prefer calling existing tools for the current phase; do NOT re-implement earlier logic.\n   - If an operation has already been completed in a previous phase, skip it and proceed. Print a brief note like: \"Skipping <operation>: already completed in a previous phase.\"\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n   - When consuming tool outputs, adhere to documented return schemas and key names without alteration.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Whenever you call a visualization tool, always save visualization outputs to `/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/` with descriptive filenames immediately.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     fig = visualization_tool_name(df, columns=[...])  # tool returns a figure\n     out_path = os.path.join(restore_path, 'images', 'visualization_tool_name.png')\n     fig.savefig(out_path)\n     plt.close(fig)\n     ```\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

For train: also plot BMI by target.\n  - For test: only summary, no target grouping.\n- Save BMI plot for train if produced.\n- Print outlier and BMI stats\u2014no changes to data.\n\n### CODE:\n```python\n# ---- Outlier detection ----\nprint(\"\\nDetecting outliers in numerical features (Train)...\")\noutlier_train = automated_outlier_detector(train, numerical_cols, method='iqr', threshold=1.5)\nprint(outlier_train)\n\nprint(\"\\nDetecting outliers in numerical features (Test)...\")\noutlier_test = automated_outlier_detector(test, numerical_cols, method='iqr', threshold=1.5)\nprint(outlier_test)\n\n# ---- BMI analysis (Train) ----\nprint(\"\\nBMI feature analysis (Train)...\")\nbmi_train_result = bmi_feature_analysis(train, height_col='Height', weight_col='Weight', target_col=target_col)\nprint(\"BMI Summary (Train):\")\nprint(bmi_train_result['bmi_summary'])\n\nif bmi_train_result['bmi_plot'] is not None:\n    bmi_train_fig_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'bmi_vs_target_train.png')\n    bmi_train_result['bmi_plot'].savefig(bmi_train_fig_path)\n    plt.close(bmi_train_result['bmi_plot'])\n    print(f\"BMI vs Target plot (train) saved to: {bmi_train_fig_path}\")\n\n# Check for implausible BMI values (e.g., <12 or >60)\nimplausible_bmi_train = bmi_train_result['bmi_series'][(bmi_train_result['bmi_series'] < 12) | (bmi_train_result['bmi_series'] > 60)]\nif not implausible_bmi_train.empty:\n    print(\"Flag: Implausible BMI values detected in train:\")\n    print(implausible_bmi_train)\n\n# ---- BMI analysis (Test) ----\nprint(\"\\nBMI feature analysis (Test)...\")\nbmi_test_result = bmi_feature_analysis(test, height_col='Height', weight_col='Weight')\nprint(\"BMI Summary (Test):\")\nprint(bmi_test_result['bmi_summary'])\n\nimplausible_bmi_test = bmi_test_result['bmi_series'][(bmi_test_result['bmi_series'] < 12) | (bmi_test_result['bmi_series'] > 60)]\nif not implausible_bmi_test.empty:\n    print(\"Flag: Implausible BMI values detected in test:\")\n    print(implausible_bmi_test)\n```\n\n### EXPLANATION:\n- Checks for outliers in all numericals in both datasets.\n- Computes and summarizes BMI in both datasets.\n- For train, saves the BMI-by-target plot and flags implausible BMI values.\n- For test, only summary and implausible value check.\n- All outputs are printed except the BMI plot, which is saved.\n\n---\n\n## TASK 4: Assess Target Distribution and Feature Relationships\n\n### THOUGHT PROCESS:\n- Use `analyze_target_distribution` to get class counts and proportions in train.\n- For key numericals (`Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, BMI): make boxplots vs. target. Save up to 4 images if within quota, prioritizing BMI and Weight.\n- Crosstab `Gender` vs. target (train) and print.\n\n### CODE:\n```python\n# ---- Target class distribution ----\nprint(\"\\nTarget variable ('NObeyesdad') distribution (Train):\")\ntarget_dist = analyze_target_distribution(train, target_col)\nprint(target_dist)\n\n# ---- Feature vs target boxplots ----\n# Prioritize BMI and Weight, then Height and Age if image quota allows\nboxplot_features = ['Weight', 'Height', 'Age']\nbmi_col_train = bmi_train_result['bmi_series']  # Already computed\n\n# Add BMI as a column temporarily for plotting\ntrain_with_bmi = train.copy()\ntrain_with_bmi['BMI'] = bmi_col_train\n\n# Plot BMI vs target\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig_bmi_box = feature_vs_target_boxplot(train_with_bmi, 'BMI', target_col, figsize=(8, 5))\nbmi_box_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'bmi_vs_target_boxplot.png')\nfig_bmi_box.savefig(bmi_box_path)\nplt.close(fig_bmi_box)\nprint(f\"BMI vs Target boxplot saved to: {bmi_box_path}\")\n\n# Plot Weight vs target\nfig_weight_box = feature_vs_target_boxplot(train, 'Weight', target_col, figsize=(8, 5))\nweight_box_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'weight_vs_target_boxplot.png')\nfig_weight_box.savefig(weight_box_path)\nplt.close(fig_weight_box)\nprint(f\"Weight vs Target boxplot saved to: {weight_box_path}\")\n\n# Crosstab Gender vs target\nprint(\"\\nCrosstab: Gender vs NObeyesdad (Train):\")\ngender_target_crosstab = pd.crosstab(train['Gender'], train[target_col])\nprint(gender_target_crosstab)\n```\n\n### EXPLANATION:\n- Analyzes and prints target distribution.\n- Plots and saves boxplots for BMI and Weight vs. target, within image quota.\n- Prints crosstab for Gender vs. target class, giving insight into potential gender effects.\n\n---\n\n**NOTE:**  \n- The total number of images saved:  \n  - Numerical distributions (1)  \n  - Categorical counts (1)  \n  - BMI vs. target (1, from BMI analysis)  \n  - BMI vs. target boxplot (1)  \n  - Weight vs. target boxplot (1)  \n  = **5 images** (well within the 10 image quota).\n\n- All outputs (except plots) are printed immediately after generation.\n\n---\n\n**This solution is modular, efficient, and strictly follows your constraints and plan.
