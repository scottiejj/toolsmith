## PLAN

### STEP 1
Task: Summarize and audit feature types, basic statistics, unique values, and missingness for all features in both train and test datasets.
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- Tools:
  - `summarize_numerical_features` for numerical features (`Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`)
  - `summarize_categorical_features` for categorical features (`Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS`, and `NObeyesdad` for train)
  - Pandas `.is_unique` and `.isnull().sum()` for `id`
- Parameters:
  - Use both train and test dataframes
Expected output or Impact on data:
- Text tables summarizing statistics, unique values, and missing counts for each feature group
- Text summary on `id` column uniqueness and missingness
- No changes to data; purely descriptive
Constraints:
- No data modification
- Use only text/print outputs for summaries

### STEP 2
Task: Analyze initial distributions for all features to identify basic patterns and spot potential data entry errors or outliers.
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- Tools:
  - `plot_numerical_distributions` for numerical features (`Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`)
    - Parameters: No target hue, `n_cols=3`, `figsize=(16, 8)`
  - `plot_categorical_counts` for categorical features (`Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS`)
    - Parameters: `n_cols=3`, `figsize=(16, 8)`
- Use train data primarily; test data if feasible
Expected output or Impact on data:
- Histograms for numerical features and countplots for categorical features (max 10 images in total)
- Descriptions before each plot
- No changes to data; visual inspection only
Constraints:
- Limit to 10 total images
- Focus on critical, representative plots

### STEP 3
Task: Detect and quantify outliers and check consistency of numerical features (including BMI).
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- Tools:
  - `automated_outlier_detector` for numerical features (`Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`)
    - Parameters: `method='iqr'`, `threshold=1.5`
  - `bmi_feature_analysis` for BMI calculation using `Height` and `Weight`
    - Parameters: `height_col='Height'`, `weight_col='Weight'`
- Apply to train and test data
Expected output or Impact on data:
- Text tables with outlier counts and ratios for each numerical feature
- BMI summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles)
- Text report flagging implausible BMI values
- No changes to data; purely diagnostic
Constraints:
- No correction or removal of data
- All outputs in text except for BMI summary if plot is critical (counted in image quota)

### STEP 4
Task: Assess target variable distribution and its relationship with key features in train data.
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- Tools:
  - `analyze_target_distribution` for `NObeyesdad`
  - `feature_vs_target_boxplot` for `Age`, `Weight`, `Height`, and BMI vs. `NObeyesdad`
    - Parameters: one plot per feature, `figsize=(8, 5)`
  - Pandas crosstab for `Gender` vs. `NObeyesdad`
- Use train data only
Expected output or Impact on data:
- Text table of target class counts and proportions
- Up to 4 boxplots (key numerical features vs. target, within image quota)
- Crosstab of `Gender` vs. target (text)
- Descriptions before each output
- No data changes; foundational understanding of target and its relationships
Constraints:
- Do not exceed 10 total images (across all steps)
- Prioritize boxplots for BMI and Weight if image quota is tight
- No deep association or multivariate analysis at this stage
