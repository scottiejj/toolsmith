## TASK 1: Summarize and Audit Feature Types, Basic Statistics, Unique Values, and Missingness

### THOUGHT PROCESS:
- Load train and test as DataFrames.
- Identify numerical and categorical columns (excluding ID and target as appropriate).
- For both train and test:
  - Use `summarize_numerical_features` for numerical columns.
  - Use `summarize_categorical_features` for categorical columns.
  - For `id`, check uniqueness and missing count.
- Print all summary tables and audit information.

### CODE:
```python
import os
import pandas as pd

# Set paths
data_path = '/Users/scottiejj/Desktop/AutoKaggle_APAPTED/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/'
image_path = os.path.join(data_path, 'pre_eda', 'images')

# Load data
train = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(data_path, 'train.csv'))
test = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(data_path, 'test.csv'))

# Define columns
id_col = 'id'
target_col = 'NObeyesdad'
numerical_cols = ['Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'FCVC', 'NCP', 'CH2O', 'FAF', 'TUE']
categorical_cols = [
    'Gender', 'family_history_with_overweight', 'FAVC', 'CAEC', 'SMOKE', 'SCC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS'
]

print("=== TRAIN DATA AUDIT ===")
# ID column
print(f"ID column uniqueness: {train[id_col].is_unique}, missing: {train[id_col].isnull().sum()}")
# Numerical summary
num_summary_train = summarize_numerical_features(train, numerical_cols)
print("\nNumerical Features Summary (Train):")
print(num_summary_train)
# Categorical summary (including target)
cat_summary_train = summarize_categorical_features(train, categorical_cols + [target_col])
print("\nCategorical Features Summary (Train):")
print(cat_summary_train)

print("\n=== TEST DATA AUDIT ===")
print(f"ID column uniqueness: {test[id_col].is_unique}, missing: {test[id_col].isnull().sum()}")
# Numerical summary
num_summary_test = summarize_numerical_features(test, numerical_cols)
print("\nNumerical Features Summary (Test):")
print(num_summary_test)
# Categorical summary (without target)
cat_summary_test = summarize_categorical_features(test, categorical_cols)
print("\nCategorical Features Summary (Test):")
print(cat_summary_test)
```

### EXPLANATION:
- Loads train and test datasets.
- For each, prints ID column uniqueness and missingness.
- Uses provided tools to summarize numerical and categorical features, including the target in train.
- All results are printed for review.

## TASK 2: Analyze Initial Distributions for All Features

### THOUGHT PROCESS:
- Visualize histograms for all numerical features (train).
- Visualize countplots for all categorical features (train).
- Limit to 10 images total for the whole EDA phase.
- Give precedence to plotting all numericals in a grid, and the most informative categorical features.
- Save all images with descriptive filenames.

### CODE:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ---- Numerical distributions ----
print("\nPlotting distributions for numerical features (Train)...")
fig_num = plot_numerical_distributions(train, numerical_cols, target_col=None, n_cols=3, figsize=(16,8))
fig_num_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'numerical_distributions_train.png')
fig_num.savefig(fig_num_path)
plt.close(fig_num)
print(f"Numerical distributions (train) saved to: {fig_num_path}")

# ---- Categorical counts ----
print("\nPlotting counts for categorical features (Train)...")
fig_cat = plot_categorical_counts(train, categorical_cols, target_col=None, n_cols=3, figsize=(16,8))
fig_cat_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'categorical_counts_train.png')
fig_cat.savefig(fig_cat_path)
plt.close(fig_cat)
print(f"Categorical counts (train) saved to: {fig_cat_path}")
```

### EXPLANATION:
- Plots all numerical features' distributions in a single figure and saves it.
- Plots all categorical features' counts in a single figure and saves it.
- Limits the image count by grouping features per plot.
- All images are saved in the prescribed directory with clear filenames.

## TASK 3: Outlier Detection and Consistency Checks (Including BMI)

### THOUGHT PROCESS:
- Use `automated_outlier_detector` (IQR, 1.5) on all numerical features (train and test).
- Use `bmi_feature_analysis` on both train and test:
  - For train: also plot BMI by target.
  - For test: only summary, no target grouping.
- Save BMI plot for train if produced.
- Print outlier and BMI stats—no changes to data.

### CODE:
```python
# ---- Outlier detection ----
print("\nDetecting outliers in numerical features (Train)...")
outlier_train = automated_outlier_detector(train, numerical_cols, method='iqr', threshold=1.5)
print(outlier_train)

print("\nDetecting outliers in numerical features (Test)...")
outlier_test = automated_outlier_detector(test, numerical_cols, method='iqr', threshold=1.5)
print(outlier_test)

# ---- BMI analysis (Train) ----
print("\nBMI feature analysis (Train)...")
bmi_train_result = bmi_feature_analysis(train, height_col='Height', weight_col='Weight', target_col=target_col)
print("BMI Summary (Train):")
print(bmi_train_result['bmi_summary'])

if bmi_train_result['bmi_plot'] is not None:
    bmi_train_fig_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'bmi_vs_target_train.png')
    bmi_train_result['bmi_plot'].savefig(bmi_train_fig_path)
    plt.close(bmi_train_result['bmi_plot'])
    print(f"BMI vs Target plot (train) saved to: {bmi_train_fig_path}")

# Check for implausible BMI values (e.g., <12 or >60)
implausible_bmi_train = bmi_train_result['bmi_series'][(bmi_train_result['bmi_series'] < 12) | (bmi_train_result['bmi_series'] > 60)]
if not implausible_bmi_train.empty:
    print("Flag: Implausible BMI values detected in train:")
    print(implausible_bmi_train)

# ---- BMI analysis (Test) ----
print("\nBMI feature analysis (Test)...")
bmi_test_result = bmi_feature_analysis(test, height_col='Height', weight_col='Weight')
print("BMI Summary (Test):")
print(bmi_test_result['bmi_summary'])

implausible_bmi_test = bmi_test_result['bmi_series'][(bmi_test_result['bmi_series'] < 12) | (bmi_test_result['bmi_series'] > 60)]
if not implausible_bmi_test.empty:
    print("Flag: Implausible BMI values detected in test:")
    print(implausible_bmi_test)
```

### EXPLANATION:
- Checks for outliers in all numericals in both datasets.
- Computes and summarizes BMI in both datasets.
- For train, saves the BMI-by-target plot and flags implausible BMI values.
- For test, only summary and implausible value check.
- All outputs are printed except the BMI plot, which is saved.

## TASK 4: Assess Target Distribution and Feature Relationships

### THOUGHT PROCESS:
- Use `analyze_target_distribution` to get class counts and proportions in train.
- For key numericals (`Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, BMI): make boxplots vs. target. Save up to 4 images if within quota, prioritizing BMI and Weight.
- Crosstab `Gender` vs. target (train) and print.

### CODE:
```python
# ---- Target class distribution ----
print("\nTarget variable ('NObeyesdad') distribution (Train):")
target_dist = analyze_target_distribution(train, target_col)
print(target_dist)

# ---- Feature vs target boxplots ----
# Prioritize BMI and Weight, then Height and Age if image quota allows
boxplot_features = ['Weight', 'Height', 'Age']
bmi_col_train = bmi_train_result['bmi_series']  # Already computed

# Add BMI as a column temporarily for plotting
train_with_bmi = train.copy()
train_with_bmi['BMI'] = bmi_col_train

# Plot BMI vs target
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig_bmi_box = feature_vs_target_boxplot(train_with_bmi, 'BMI', target_col, figsize=(8, 5))
bmi_box_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'bmi_vs_target_boxplot.png')
fig_bmi_box.savefig(bmi_box_path)
plt.close(fig_bmi_box)
print(f"BMI vs Target boxplot saved to: {bmi_box_path}")

# Plot Weight vs target
fig_weight_box = feature_vs_target_boxplot(train, 'Weight', target_col, figsize=(8, 5))
weight_box_path = os.path.join(image_path, 'weight_vs_target_boxplot.png')
fig_weight_box.savefig(weight_box_path)
plt.close(fig_weight_box)
print(f"Weight vs Target boxplot saved to: {weight_box_path}")

# Crosstab Gender vs target
print("\nCrosstab: Gender vs NObeyesdad (Train):")
gender_target_crosstab = pd.crosstab(train['Gender'], train[target_col])
print(gender_target_crosstab)
```

### EXPLANATION:
- Analyzes and prints target distribution.
- Plots and saves boxplots for BMI and Weight vs. target, within image quota.
- Prints crosstab for Gender vs. target class, giving insight into potential gender effects.

---

**NOTE:**  
- The total number of images saved:  
  - Numerical distributions (1)  
  - Categorical counts (1)  
  - BMI vs. target (1, from BMI analysis)  
  - BMI vs. target boxplot (1)  
  - Weight vs. target boxplot (1)  
  = **5 images** (well within the 10 image quota).

- All outputs (except plots) are printed immediately after generation.
