# Data Information

## Data Type

### ID type
- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point (NOT used for model training).

### Numerical type
- `Age`: Age of the individual (float).
- `Height`: Height in meters (float).
- `Weight`: Weight in kilograms (float).
- `FCVC`: Frequency of consumption of vegetables (float).
- `NCP`: Number of main meals (float).
- `CH2O`: Daily water consumption (float).
- `FAF`: Physical activity frequency (float; hours per week or similar unit).
- `TUE`: Time using technology devices (float; hours per day or similar unit).

### Categorical type
- `Gender`: Male/Female.
- `family_history_with_overweight`: yes/no.
- `FAVC`: Frequent consumption of high caloric food (yes/no).
- `CAEC`: Consumption of food between meals (Sometimes/Frequently/Always/no).
- `SMOKE`: Smoking habit (yes/no).
- `SCC`: Monitoring of caloric consumption (yes/no).
- `CALC`: Consumption of alcohol (Sometimes/Frequently/Always/no).
- `MTRANS`: Transportation used (Public_Transportation/Automobile/etc.).
- `NObeyesdad`: Obesity level/type (target variable; e.g., Obesity_Type_II, Normal_Weight, etc.).

### Datetime type
- None present in this dataset.

## Detailed data description

The dataset contains information related to demographic, lifestyle, and behavioral factors that may influence body weight and obesity. Each data point represents an individual and includes:

- **Demographics:** Gender, Age.
- **Anthropometrics:** Height, Weight.
- **Family History:** Information about family history of overweight.
- **Dietary Habits:** Frequency of high caloric food, vegetable consumption, number of meals, water intake, snacking habits.
- **Lifestyle:** Smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, time spent on technology, use of caloric monitoring, and transportation means.

**Notable patterns and characteristics:**
- Most categorical features are 'yes/no' or have limited options (e.g., Sometimes/Frequently/Always/no).
- Numerical features are continuous and may require normalization.
- The target variable (`NObeyesdad`) is multi-class, indicating different levels and types of obesity or normal/insufficient weight.
- No datetime or time-series features are present.
- The data may include outliers (e.g., high weights or heights) and missing values appear unlikely from the sample provided.

## Target Variable

- **Target:** `NObeyesdad`
- **Description:** Categorical variable indicating the obesity weight status of the individual. Example classes include:
    - Insufficient_Weight
    - Normal_Weight
    - Overweight_Level_I
    - Overweight_Level_II
    - Obesity_Type_I
    - Obesity_Type_II
    - Obesity_Type_III

## Submission format (if applicable)

The submission file should contain:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each individual (integer).
- `NObeyesdad`: Predicted obesity class for each individual (string; one of the classes as in the target variable).

**Example:**
| id    | NObeyesdad         |
|-------|--------------------|
| 20758 | Obesity_Type_II    |
| 20759 | Normal_Weight      |
| ...   | ...                |

- Types: `id` (integer), `NObeyesdad` (string/category)
