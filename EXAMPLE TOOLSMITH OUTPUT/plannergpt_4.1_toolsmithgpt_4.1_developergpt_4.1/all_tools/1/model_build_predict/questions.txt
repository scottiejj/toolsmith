## QUESTIONS
### Question 1
What models were trained during this phase, and what were their respective cross-validated performance metrics (mean accuracy and macro-F1 score)?

### Question 2
Which features were included in the final model training, and were there any notable observations regarding their significance or contribution to the model performance?

### Question 3
How did you ensure consistency between the training and test datasets in terms of feature selection and encoding? Were there any challenges encountered?

### Question 4
What approach was taken for final model selection, and what were the criteria for choosing the final model for prediction?

### Question 5
What is the predicted class distribution of the `NObeyesdad` variable in the test set, and how does it compare with the expected distribution based on the training data?

### Question 6
What were the key lessons learned during the Model Building, Validation, and Prediction phase that could inform future modeling efforts or competition strategies?
