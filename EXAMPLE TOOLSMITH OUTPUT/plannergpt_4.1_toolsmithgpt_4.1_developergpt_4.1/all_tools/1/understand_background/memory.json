The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\n### Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\n### Prizes\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n\n**Please note:**\u00a0In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series.

                    "content": "Based on the overview and data information provided, here\u2019s a comprehensive analysis of the \"obesity_risks\" data science competition:\n\n### 1. Competition Overview\nThe \"obesity_risks\" competition is part of the Kaggle Playground Series, where the primary goal is to predict the risk of obesity in individuals, which is associated with cardiovascular diseases. Participants are challenged to use various factors to classify individuals into different obesity risk categories. The competition runs from February 1, 2024, to March 1, 2024, and submissions will be evaluated based on accuracy.\n\n### 2. Files\nThe competition provides three essential files:\n- **train.csv**: This file contains the training dataset, which includes various features related to individuals' demographics and lifestyle choices. The target variable is `NObeyesdad`, indicating obesity classification.\n  \n- **test.csv**: This file consists of the test dataset for which participants must predict the target variable `NObeyesdad`.\n  \n- **sample_submission.csv**: A template for the submission file demonstrating the required format for the predictions.\n\n### 3. Problem Definition\nThe problem requires participants to predict the obesity classification of individuals based on several features. The target variable, `NObeyesdad`, includes multiple classes representing different levels of obesity. The objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts these classes for the test dataset.\n\n### 4. Data Information\n#### 4.1 Data Type\n- **ID type**\n  - `id`: A unique identifier for each data point (not used in model training).\n  \n- **Numerical type**\n  - `Age`: Age of the individual (in years).\n  - `Height`: Height (in meters).\n  - `Weight`: Weight (in kilograms).\n  - `CH2O`: Daily water intake (liters).\n  - `FAF`: Frequency of physical activity.\n  - `TUE`: Time spent exercising (in hours).\n  - `CALC`: Daily calcium intake (grams).\n\n- **Categorical type**\n  - `Gender`: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).\n  - `family_history_with_overweight`: Family history of overweight (yes/no).\n  - `FAVC`: Food intake frequency (yes/no).\n  - `FCVC`: Frequency of vegetable consumption (numerical scale).\n  - `NCP`: Number of meals consumed per day (numerical scale).\n  - `CAEC`: Consumption of food between meals (categorical).\n  - `SMOKE`: Smoking status (yes/no).\n  - `SCC`: Self-calculated calories (yes/no).\n  - `MTRANS`: Means of transportation (categorical).\n  - `NObeyesdad`: Level of obesity (target variable).\n\n- **Datetime type**\n  - None.\n\n#### 4.2 Detailed Data Description\nThe dataset is structured into two segments: training and testing. It captures demographic and lifestyle information, such as age, gender, height, weight, dietary habits, and physical activities. The target variable classifies individuals into obesity levels, ranging from \"Insufficient Weight\" to \"Obesity Type III.\" Observations include:\n- Predominantly young adults (ages 18-32).\n- Variations in height and weight.\n- Significant prevalence of family history related to overweight.\n- Engagement in physical activities varies among individuals.\n- Common modes of transportation include public transport and automobiles.\n\n### 5. Target Variable\nThe target variable, `NObeyesdad`, categorizes obesity levels into the following classes:\n- \"Insufficient Weight\"\n- \"Normal Weight\"\n- \"Overweight Level I\"\n- \"Overweight Level II\"\n- \"Obesity Type I\"\n- \"Obesity Type II\"\n- \"Obesity Type III\"\n\n### 6. Evaluation Metrics\nSubmissions will be evaluated using the accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted classifications out of the total predictions made.\n\n### 7. Submission Format\nThe final submission file must contain the following columns:\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `NObeyesdad`: Predicted obesity classification.\n\nAn example format for the submission file is:\n```\nid,NObeyesdad\n20758,Normal_Weight\n20759,Normal_Weight\n20760,Obesity Type I\n```\n\n### 8. Other Key Aspects\n- The competition utilizes a synthetically generated dataset, allowing for a blend of real-world data characteristics while maintaining the confidentiality of test labels.\n- Participants are encouraged to explore data visualizations, clustering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) as part of their solutions.\n- To enhance participation, prizes consist of Kaggle merchandise, and multiple entries from the same person are limited to once per season.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis comprehensive analysis provides essential insights into the \"obesity_risks\" competition, including the purpose of each file, the structure of the data, the target variable, evaluation metrics, and submission format. Understanding these aspects will be crucial for successfully navigating through the competition phases, particularly in exploratory data analysis and model building."

The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,NObeyesdad\n20758,Normal_Weight\n20759,Normal_Weight\n20760,Normal_Weight\netc.\n```\n\n### Timeline\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- **Start Date**\u00a0- February 1, 2024\n- **Entry Deadline**\u00a0- Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n- **Team Merger Deadline**\u00a0- Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n- **Final Submission Deadline**\u00a0- February 29, 2024\n\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\n\n### About the Tabular Playground Series\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nThe goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\n### Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\n### Prizes\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n\n**Please note:**\u00a0In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series.
