# Data Information

## Data Type

### ID type
- **id**: Unique identifier for each data point; should NOT be used in model training.

### Numerical type
- **Age**: Age of the individual (float).
- **Height**: Height in meters (float).
- **Weight**: Weight in kilograms (float).
- **FCVC**: Frequency of consumption of vegetables (float, typically 1-3).
- **NCP**: Number of main meals (float, commonly 1-4).
- **CH2O**: Daily water intake (float, typically 1-3).
- **FAF**: Physical activity frequency (float, hours per week).
- **TUE**: Time using technology (float, hours per day).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, calculated from Height and Weight (float).
- **BMI_flag**: Boolean indicating BMI outlier (False = not outlier, True = outlier).
- **Age_outlier_flag**: Boolean for age outliers.
- **Height_outlier_flag**: Boolean for height outliers.
- **Weight_outlier_flag**: Boolean for weight outliers.
- **FCVC_outlier_flag**: Boolean for FCVC outliers.
- **NCP_outlier_flag**: Boolean for NCP outliers.
- **CH2O_outlier_flag**: Boolean for CH2O outliers.
- **FAF_outlier_flag**: Boolean for FAF outliers.
- **TUE_outlier_flag**: Boolean for TUE outliers.
- **BMI_outlier_flag**: Boolean for BMI outliers.

### Categorical type
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **family_history_with_overweight**: yes or no.
- **FAVC**: Frequent consumption of high caloric food (yes/no).
- **CAEC**: Consumption of food between meals (No, Sometimes, Frequently, Always).
- **SMOKE**: Smoking habit (yes/no).
- **SCC**: Monitors daily calorie consumption (yes/no).
- **CALC**: Consumption of alcohol (No, Sometimes, Frequently, Always).
- **MTRANS**: Mode of transportation (Automobile, Public_transportation, etc.).

#### Only in train data:
- **NObeyesdad**: Target variable, obesity category.

### Datetime type
- None present. All variables are numerical, categorical, or boolean.

## Detailed data description
- The dataset consists of biometric, lifestyle, and behavioral characteristics of individuals, intended for obesity classification.
- Data fields include physical measures (age, height, weight, BMI), dietary patterns (number of main meals, water consumption, vegetable and high-calorie food consumption), activity patterns (physical activity, technology use), and some medical history (family history with overweight).
- Outlier flags are included for key numerical variables, indicating whether a value is statistically unusual.
- Most variables are cleanly encoded as floats or clear categorical labels.
- The train data contains the target label (`NObeyesdad`), which is a multi-class classification of obesity status (e.g., Normal_Weight, Insufficient_Weight, Overweight_Level_I/II, Obesity_Type_II/III).
- The test data does not include the target variable, as is typical in predictive modeling scenarios.
- There is no missing data visible in the provided sample; values are either present as floats, strings, or booleans.
- The id field is unique for each record and should only be used for tracking or submission, not for model training.

## Target Variable
- **NObeyesdad**: The target variable; a categorical feature indicating the obesity level of the individual. Possible classes include:
  - Insufficient_Weight
  - Normal_Weight
  - Overweight_Level_I
  - Overweight_Level_II
  - Obesity_Type_I
  - Obesity_Type_II
  - Obesity_Type_III

## Submission format (if applicable)
- The submission file should contain at least the following columns:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for each sample (integer).
  - **NObeyesdad**: Predicted class label for obesity status (string, one of the categories listed above).
- Data types:
  - id: integer
  - NObeyesdad: string (categorical)

*Note: For model training, all features except 'id' can be used. Outlier flags are booleans that may be useful for modeling or feature engineering.*
