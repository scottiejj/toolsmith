With the tool descriptions in hand, let's revisit the section of the code causing the error. The error is thrown during the reindexing operation:

```python
# Align columns of test_fe with train_fe to ensure they have the same columns
test_fe = test_fe.reindex(columns=train_fe.columns, fill_value=0)
```

The error message indicates that there are duplicate labels in the columns of `train_fe`, which is causing the reindexing to fail. Given the provided tools, none of them directly address duplicate column handling, but several operations could potentially introduce duplicate columns, such as:

- One-hot encoding with `one_hot_encode_columns` or `pd.get_dummies`, if categorical columns contain identical category names.
- The manual alignment of columns as attempted in the snippet above.

To rectify this, you would need to ensure that `train_fe` does not have duplicate column names before attempting to reindex `test_fe`. The error lies in the fact that `train_fe.columns` contains duplicates, which is not permissible for reindexing. The solution would involve checking and resolving any column name conflicts in `train_fe` before proceeding with reindexing.
